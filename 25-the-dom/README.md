# The Document Object Model

### What is the DOM?

* Object-oriented representation of the webpage which allows programs to manipulate the properties and contents on the page
* When HTML is compiled, the DOM is created based on that HTML
* Javascript is a language created to manipulate the DOM

### Brief tour of Developer Tools

* Open the Dev Tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting 'View Page Source' from the context menu
* View DOM in the 'Elements' tab
  * Show that HTML is directly editable in the main panel
  * Show 'Styles' tab to view and manipulate CSS
  * Show pointer feature to find elements by hovering over the DOM
* JS Console
  * If they haven't seen it already, show them how the console works

### CSS Selectors

* Individual selectors
  * Class `.class`
  * ID `#id`
  * Tag `div`
* Combining Selectors
  * Space between `#parent .child`
  * Chain `div.image.highlighted`

### Selecting DOM Nodes

* Understand types that are returned form selecting a DOM node with JavaScript
* Understand how to use CSS selectors
* Methods

  ```js
  node.querySelector('#unique-element')
  node.querySelectorAll('.some-shared-class')
  node.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]
  node.getElementById('unique-element')
  node.getElementsByClassName('some-shared-class')
  ```

* Mention that `NodeList` is array-like, but does not have iterators built on it. Can be borrowed from `Array.prototype`
* Chain CSS selectors to get greater specificity

### Modifying DOM Nodes

* Storing node in a variable `let body = document.querySelector('body')`
* Changing attributes `body.style.backgroundColor = red`
* `innerText` and `textContent` vs. `innerHTML`
* Removing elements `document.removeChild(body)`

### Creating DOM Objects

* Instantiating new elements `let element = document.createElement('img')`
* Adding attributes to elements `element.src = 'http://www.coooolimage.com'`
* Appending to node `document.body.appendChild(element)`

### Activity

Students will go to their favorite websites and modify the DOM programmatically. Wikipedia and Twitter are good examples.

* Students should:
  * Select elements and save them to variables
  * Delete at least 2 elements
  * Modify elements (e.g., replace image url, change text, change CSS)
  * Create new elements and add to page

* Encourage students to think programmatically about the DOM by giving them problems that involve iteration and the use of multiple CSS selectors
  * Change all instances of one word
  * Replace all images on only a certain portion of the DOM
  * Change every other header
  * Bonus (Hard): replace all elements of one tag to another (e.g., `p` to `h1`)
